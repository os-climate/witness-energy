**Definition:**

Methanol (CH3OH) is the simplest alcohol molecule. It has many applications and is mostly used in chemicals and 
industrial areas. But it also as potential as a fuel, through combustion reaction:

$$2CH_{3}OH + 3O_{2} --> 2CO_{2} + 4H_{2}O$$

Methanol production can be separated into 2 kinds of processes [^2] [^4] : 
  * through syngas reforming: in(syngas), out(methanol, water) [NOT IMPLEMENTED YET]
  * through direct CO2 hydrogenation: in(carbon dioxide, hydrogen), out(methanol, water)

Although, usually plants are constructed to take a source fuel (biomass, natural gas,...) to produce the syngas on site.

Significant datas for liquid fuel [^1]:

  * Chemical Formula : CH3OH
  * Molar mass : 32.04 g/mol
  * Density: 792 kg/m^3
  * CO2 after use : 1.37 kg/kg
  * CH4 after use : 0.0 kg/kg
  * N2O after use : 0.0 kg/kg
  * High Calorific value : 6.39 kWh/kg
  
The advantages of Methanol as a fuel[^3]:

  * It could be used in the auto industry without having to replace the current thermic engine automobile fleet  
  * It is liquid at room temperature and thus easier to store

The disadvantages of Methanol as a fuel:

  * It is less dense than other liquid fuel (diesel for example) and would thus require more fill-ups
  * The lesser lubrification compared to other oils may increase the wear and tear costs
