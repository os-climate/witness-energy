**Definition ([^1]):**

Hydrogen, naturally in gaseous form at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, can be liquefied to simplify transport and storage by cooling below -252.87 °C. It is a commun liquid rocket fuel, since it can be burn with liquid oxygene to produce water:

$$2H_2 + O_2 → 2H_2O$$

Significant datas for liquid hydrogen [^2]:
  * Chemical Formula : H2
  * Molecular Weight : 2.016 g/mol
  * Boiling Point at 1 atm : -423.2 F (-252.9 C)
  * Freezing Point at 1 atm : -434.8 F (-259.3 C)
  * Critical Temperature : -400.4 F (-240.2 C)
  * Critical Pressure 186 psia (12.7 atm)
  * Density, Liquid at B.P., 1 atm 4.42 lb./cu.ft. (70.8 kg/m^3)

Water is often considered harmless for the environment and it can be considered "zero emission", however, water vapor emitted in the athmosphere contribute to global warming (to a lesser extent than CO2).

The energy cost to produce 1 kg of LH2 is between 10 to 12 kWh/kg for current industrial liquefaction plants, and goes down to around 6.0 kWh/kg in R&D prototypes.
The losses of H2 to produce LH2 are estimated around 1.6 % from input stream to output stream.
