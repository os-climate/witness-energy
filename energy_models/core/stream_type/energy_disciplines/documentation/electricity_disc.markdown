**Definition (extracted from [^1]):**

Electricity is not freely available in nature, so it must be "produced" (that is, transforming other forms of energy to electricity). Production is carried out in power stations (also called "power plants"). Electricity is most often generated at a power plant by electromechanical generators, primarily driven by heat engines fueled by combustion or nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind. Other energy sources include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power.

We consider several methods for production:

* Coal-fired power plants
* Gas power plant
* Nuclear
* Geothermal
* Hydropower
* Solar photovoltaic
* Solar thermal
* Wind On & Off shore

**World Production:**

World electricity production was estimated around 26 000 TWh in 2019, and the following figure shows the breakdown per technology:

**Price:**

The selection of electricity production modes and their economic viability varies in accordance with demand and region. The economics vary considerably around the world, resulting in widespread residential selling prices, e.g. the price in Serbia is around 6 cents per kWh while Germany has one of the most expensive electricity price around 30 cents per kWh (€). 

**CO2 impact:**

Electricity generation accounts for nearly 40% of total CO2 emissions, the largest of any source, the following map shows the carbon intensity of several countries depending on each electricity mix:
