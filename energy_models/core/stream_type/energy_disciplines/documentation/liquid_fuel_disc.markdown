**Definition (extracted from [^1]):**

Liquid fuels are combustible or energy-generating molecules that can be harnessed to create mechanical energy, usually producing kinetic energy; they also must take the shape of their container. It is the fumes of liquid fuels that are flammable instead of the fluid. Most liquid fuels in widespread use are derived from fossil fuels, and play a primary role in transportation and economy.

Significant datas for liquid fuel [^2]:

  * Chemical Formula : C12H26âˆ’C15H32
  * Molecular Weight : 170.0 g/mol
  * Density: 821 kg/m^3
  * CO2 after use : 3.15 kgCO2/kg [^3]
  * N2O after use : 0.006 kt/PJ [^4]
  * Calorific value : 11.9 kWh/kg

We consider several methods for production:

* Fischer-Tropsch
* Refinery
