# Carbon Utilization in Fuel Production:
CO2 can be used to enhance yields of biological processes, such as algae production and crop cultivation in greenhouses. The application of CO2 with low-temperature heat in industrial greenhouses is the most mature yield-boosting application today, and can increase yields by 25% to 30%. The clear leader in the use of CO2 in greenhouses is the Netherlands, with an estimated annual consumption between 5 and 6.3 MtCO2. Of this amount,The carbon in CO2 can be used to produce fuels that are in use today, including methane, methanol, gasoline and aviation fuels. The process involves using the CO2 in combination with hydrogen, which is highly energy-intensive to produce, and results in a carbon-containing fuel that is easier to handle and use than pure hydrogen (Figure 5). Low-carbon hydrogen can be produced from fossil fuels when combined with CCS, or through electrolysis of water using low-carbon electricity.

CO2-derived fuels are particularly interesting for applications where the use of other low-carbon energy carriers, such as electricity or hydrogen, is extremely challenging, such as in aviation. Several firms have already built demonstration and pilot plants producing methane and methanol from CO2 and hydrogen, together using hundreds to thousands of tonnes of CO2 per year. Other chemical and biological conversion pathways to produce CO2-derived fuels are in the early research or demonstration stages[^1].


### Algae production [^1]
CO2 can be used to enhance yields of biological processes, such as algae production and crop cultivation in greenhouses. The application of CO2 with low-temperature heat in industrial greenhouses is the most mature yield-boosting application today, and can increase yields by 25% to 30%. The clear leader in the use of CO2 in greenhouses is the Netherlands, with an estimated annual consumption between 5 and 6.3 MtCO2. Of this amount, approximately 500 ktCO2 per year comes from external sources, mainly industrial plants, with the balance taken from on-site gas-fired boilers or co-generation systems 8. The replacement of these on-site systems with other industrial CO2 sources or with CO2 captured directly from the atmosphere could deliver climate benefits.
