**Definition (extracted from [^1]):**
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the process of capturing waste carbon dioxide (CO2), transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere. Usually the CO2 is captured from large point sources, such as a cement factory or biomass power plant, and normally it is stored in an underground geological formation. The aim is to prevent the release of large quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere from heavy industry, and so help to limit climate change. Although CO2 has been injected into geological formations for several decades for various purposes, including enhanced oil recovery, the long-term storage of CO2 is a relatively new concept.

Carbon capture is sub-divided into two groups of technologies, depending on the context.

**Direct Air Capture (DAC):**
Direct Air Capture technologies capture CO2 directly from the atmosphere.
The technologies taken into account are:

* Amine scrubbing
* Calcium-Potassium scrubbing


**Flue Gas capture:**
Flue gas is a high CO2-concentrated gas, usually the result of plant activities such as coal burning plant.
Carbon Capture technologies dealing with flue gas allow to reduce CO2 emissions from plant activities

The technologies taken into account are:



* Calcium looping
* Chilled ammonia process
* CO2 membranes
* Monoethanolamine scrubbing
* Piperazine process
* Pressure swing adsorption

Flue gas capture is limited by the amount of flue gas available at the exit of CO2 emissing factories. The model limits (smoothly with an exponential to avoid zero gradients) the carbon capture via flue gas with the real amount of flue gas available. The mean CO2 concentration in the flue gas is retained to compute the economic data of each flue gas technology.
