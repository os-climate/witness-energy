class Methanol(EnergyType):
    # Methanol (CH3OH) is the simplest alcohol, and is also known as methyl alcohol.
    # It is mostly used in the production of chemicals, as well as in the manufacturing of
    # polyester fibers, acrylic plastics, and various pharmaceuticals.
    # It can also be used as an alternative fuel through combustion reaction
