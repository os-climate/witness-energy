    Vegetable oil can be used as an alternative fuel in diesel engines and in heating oil burners. When vegetable
    oil is used directly as a fuel, in either modified or unmodified equipment, it is referred to as straight
    vegetable oil (SVO) or pure plant oil (PPO). Conventional diesel engines can be modified to help ensure that
    the viscosity of the vegetable oil is low enough to allow proper atomization of the fuel. This prevents
    incomplete combustion, which would damage the engine by causing a build-up of carbon. Straight vegetable
    oil can also be blended with conventional diesel or processed into biodiesel, HVO or bioliquids for use
    under a wider range of conditions. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_oil_fuel)
