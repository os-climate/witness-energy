# Investments Distribution

The distribution of investments is made according to the investments coming from the design space. A constraint is computed in order to obtain a sum of investments lower than the investment dedicated for energy production coming from the macroeconomics model.

$$investment\_constraint = energy\_investment > \sum technos\_investments$$
