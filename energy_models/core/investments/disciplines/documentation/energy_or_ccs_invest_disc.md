# Investments Distribution between CCS and Energy conversion

The distribution of global investments into CCS and energy conversion is made following a percentage of CCS investment compared to global investment. 

$$ccs\_investment = global\_investment * \frac{ccs\_mix\_percentage}{100}$$

$$energy\_conversion\_investment = global\_investment *(1.0- \frac{ccs\_mix\_percentage}{100})$$
