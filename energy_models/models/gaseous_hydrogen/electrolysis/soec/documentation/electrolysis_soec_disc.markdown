# SOEC (Solid Oxyde Electrolyser Cell) Electrolysis

The solid oxide electrolysis (SOE) first introduced by Donitz and Erdle in the 1980s. Solid oxide electrolysis has attracted an abundant deal of attention due to the electrical energy converts into the chemical energy along with producing the ultra-pure hydrogen with greater efficiency. Solid oxide electrolysis operates at high pressure and high temperatures 500-850 C and utilizes the water in the form of steam. [^1]

The following reactions take place:

Anode: $$O_2-  --> 0.5 O_2 + 2 e^-$$
Cathode: $$H_20 + 2 e^-  --> H_2 +O_2^-$$


Full reaction : $$H_20 --> H_2 + 1/2O_2$$

SOEC provides a market-leading system electrical efficiency of 84 % in Sunfire facility [^2] which can goes to above 90 % for Topsoe's industries [^3].

CAPEX estimates for SOEC electrolysers range across 2 800 to 600 USD/kW depending on nominal power (Here we considered the minimal CAPEX for the technology) with an OPEX of 3% [^4].



SOEC is in a pre-commercial and fundamental research stage although Sunfire is already offering systems of 150 kW in a 20 ft or 40 ft
container. Other companies investigating the SOEC technologies are Haldor Topsoe (incooperation with Riso DTU), Cermatec (in cooperation with the
Idaho National Laboratory), FuelCell Energy and Toshiba. The initial production of the technology is assumed negligible.

## Heat
In Electrolysis, heat production assumed the net difference between total electricity consumption and total hydrogen production.
