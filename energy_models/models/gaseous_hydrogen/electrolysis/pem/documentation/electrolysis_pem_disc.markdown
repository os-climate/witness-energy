# PEM (Proton Exchange Membranes) Electrolysis

PEM electrolysers use a proton exchange membrane to separate the protons (H+) from water and oxygen. Operating conditions range between 20-100 C and up to 100 bar.

The following reactions take place:

Anode: $$H_2O   --> 0.5 O_2 + 2 H^+ + 2 e^-$$

Cathode: $$2 H^+ + 2 e^-  --> H_2$$


The first PEM water electrolysis was idealized by Grubb in the early fifties and was developed by General Electric in 1966 to overcome the drawbacks to the alkaline water electrolysis [^2].
A particular concern in PEMEL (PEM Electrolysis) is the required use of Iridium, which is a very rare metal and is considered a critical material [^1].


The cost of hydrogen production from electrolysis, through PEM given by IRENA in 2017 is 6.7 EUR/kg of H2; potential to drop to 4.1 EUR/kg in 2025 [^3].
The CAPEX of PEM is expected to decrease from 1 200 EUR/kW (2017) to 700 EUR/kW (2025) [^3] which gives a CAPEX in 2020 of 1012.5 EUR/kW.
PEM electrolyser OPEX costs are 2 - 3 % of CAPEX excluding electricity [^4].

It is worth to note, that electrolysers are still built in small volumes for niche markets, which puts the large expected costs reductions into context. Significant cost reductions are expected to come from technology innovations, improved supply chains and bigger production volumes, which enable more efficient manufacturing techniques [^4].

PEM electrolysers need expensive noble metals (platinum, iridium) which makes them more expensive and less efficient than alkaline electrolysers [^2].


PEM electrolysers are not yet fully developped but Buttler [^6] reported around 6MW of PEM electrolysers nominal power around the world in 2017. With new project emerging, the nominal power of PEM is around 50MW in 2021 (a new 10MW hydrogen electrolysis plant, the largest of its kind in Europe operates in 2020[^7] and another 20 MW, the largest of its kind in the world, will start operating in 2021 in Quebec (Canada) [^10] ) leading to a global hydrogen production of 0.4TWh per year.
Public investment in Europe for electrolysers is handled by the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH-JU) organism [^8].In 2019, european investments was around 156 MEUR or around 190 MDollars. We assume half of it is dedicated tor PEM. Around 36% of PEM electrolysers is financed by European union worldwide [^9]. Consequently the hypothesis investment in 2019 for PEM is around :

$$\frac{190*100}{2*36}= 263.88 \ MDollars$$

## Heat
In Electrolysis, heat production assumed the net difference between total electricity consumption and total hydrogen production.
