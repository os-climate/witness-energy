# First Generation Biofuel, FAME Biodiesel

## What is Biodiesel?
The major components of vegetable oils and animal fats are triacylglycerols (often also called triglycerides). Chemically, triacylglycerols are esters of fatty acids with glycerol.
For obtaining biodiesel, the vegetable oil or animal fat is subjected to a chemical reaction termed transesterification. In that reaction, the vegetable oil or animal fat is reacted in the presence of a catalyst (usually Sodium Hydroxide or Potassium Hydroxide) with an alcohol (usually methanol) to give the corresponding alkyl esters (when using methanol, the methyl esters) of the fatty acid mixture that is found in the parent vegetable oil or animal fat.
Biodiesel can be produced from a great variety of feedstocks. These feedstocks include most common vegetable oils (soybean, cottonseed, palm, peanut, rapeseed /canola, sunfl ower, saffl ower, coconut, etc.) and animal fats (usually tallow) as well as waste oils (used frying oils, etc.). Which feedstock is used depends largely on geography.
Biodiesel is miscible with petrodiesel in all ratios. This has led to the use of blends of biodiesel with petrodiesel instead of neat biodiesel in many countries. It is important to note that blending with petrodiesel is not biodiesel. Often blends with petrodiesel are denoted by acronyms such as B20 which is a blend of 20% biodiesel with petrodiesel.[^1]

Transesterification is a multiple-step reaction, including three reversible steps in series, where triglycerides are transformed into diglycerides. Diglycerides are converted to monoglycerides and then converted to esters (biodiesel) and glycerol (by-product).
Transesterification is a chemical reaction used in biodiesel production. It is not primarily intended as a heat production process.

Methanol is used as alcohol for producing biodiesel because it is the least expensive alcohols, for example ethanol or iso-propanol, may afford a biodiesel fuel with better fuel properties. Often the resulting product is also called FAME (fatty acid methyl esters) instead of biodiesel. Although other alcohols can by definition give biodiesel, many now existing standards are designed in such a fashion that only methyl esters can be used as biodiesel when observing the standards.

## Advantages & Problems
Biodiesel has several distinct advantages compared to petrodiesel besides being fully competitive with petrodiesel in most technical aspects:
* Derived from a renewable domestic resource, thus reducing dependence on and preserving petroleum.
* Biodegradability.
* Reduces most regulated exhaust emissions (with the exception of nitrogen oxides,
NOx ).
* Higher flash point leading to safer handling and storage.
* Excellent lubricity. This fact is steadily gaining significance with the advent of low-sulfur petrodiesel fuels, which have significantly reduced lubricity. Adding biodiesel at low levels (1-2%) restores the lubricity.

Some problems associated with biodiesel are its inherent higher price, which in many countries is offset by legislative and regulatory incentives or subsidies in the form of reduced excise taxes, slightly increased NOx exhaust emissions, stability when exposed to air (oxidative stability), and cold flow properties. The higher price can also be (partially) offset by the use of less expensive feedstocks which has sparked the interest in materials such as waste oils (for example, used frying oils).

## Use in Jet Fuel
Biodiesel have also a potential to be used as a blending agent in jetfuel because certain FAME molecules can fit the jetfuel fuel performance criteria if fractionated. It is still a research area and not mature yet.
