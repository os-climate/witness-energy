# Autothermal reforming

Autothermal reforming uses CO_2 and oxygen in a reaction with methane to form syngas.  The reaction takes place in a single chamber where the methane is partially oxidized. The reaction is exothermic due to the oxidation.

$$2CH_4 + O_2 + CO_2 --> 3CO + H_2O + 3H_2$$

The syngas produced ratio of H2:CO is 1:1.
