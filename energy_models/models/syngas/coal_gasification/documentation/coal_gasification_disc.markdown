# Syngas from Coal Gasification

## Definition
Coal gasification is the process of producing syngas from coal,water and oxygen. During gasification, the coal is blown through with oxygen and water vapor : 

$$ 3C(coal) + O_2 + H_2O \rightarrow H_2 + 3CO$$

If the refiner wants to produce liquid fuels, the coal gas is collected at this state and routed to a Fischer–Tropsch reactor. If, however, hydrogen is the desired end-product, the coal gas (primarily the CO product) undergoes the water gas shift reaction. 

## World production 

The two main applications of coal gasification are to produce energy (hydrogen with Water Gas Shift reaction and liquid fuels with Fischer Tropsch reaction) and to reduced iron from iron ore.

 Almost 23 % of Hydrogen is produced with coal gasification mostly in China. The world's largest scale implementation of Fischer–Tropsch technology in South Africa is based on coal gasification. 

 In industry, syngas from coal gasification is used to transform iron oxides extracted from iron mines into iron ore using the Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) technology : 

 $$ 2FeO + (CO + H_2) \rightarrow 2Fe + CO_2 + H_2O $$

 IEA website reports a coal consumption of 3333 TWh for other transormation (includes Hydrogen and DRI) and 264.72 TWh for liquefaction plants.
