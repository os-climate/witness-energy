# Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)


Hydrogen production using steam methane reforming (SMR) is a two-step process. The first step is to inject water vapor at very high temperature (700 to 1000 Celsius degrees) with methane in a pressurized environment (3 to 25 bars), which is the SMR process. The reaction generates hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) :


$$CH_4 + H_20 (+heat) --> CO + 3H_2$$

The Water Gas Shift process is then used to extract hydrogen from syngas mix.

## World production

Annual global hydrogen production is around 70 million tonnes of hydrogen and around 75% comes from natural gas reforming.[^1]
Syngas from natural gas is also used in liquefaction plants in the Gas to Liquid process (GtL).In Qatar, the second largest FT plant in the world converts natural gas to petroleum liquids at a rate of 140,000 barrels per day.Another plant in Qatar has a capacity of 34,000 barrels per day.[^4]

Economic and technical datas is taken from Keipi & al [^2], Diglio & al [^3].

## Heat
[^5] Natural gas and steam are fed to the pre-reformer where the heavies are converted to methane to
prevent soot and enhance the efficiency of the process . More steam is added prior to entering the main reactor, where syngas is produced, in an equilibrium-limited endothermic reaction:

CH<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → CO + 3H<sub>2</sub> .... ΔH°= 206 kJ/mol
