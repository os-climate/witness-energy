# Syngas from Biomass Gasification

## Definition
‘Gasification’ means the thermal destruction of biomass in a reducing atmosphere of steam or air (or both) to produce a medium- or low-calorific value gas which can subsequently be converted to other fuel forms, chemicals, hydrogen, and other products

Biomass resources mainly include agriculture crops, agriculture crop waste, wood, wood waste and animal manure. A biomass analysis reveals a concentration of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen and a bit of Sulfur and Nitrogen.

## Principle of work
The gasifier is the core equipment unit for the hydrogen production process. Fuels (such as coal and biomass) are used in the gasification process, and fuel is converted to syngas primarily containing CO, CO2, H2, H2O and CH4. The composition of syngas derived from gasification mainly depends on the fuel, gasifier type and gasification agent.

The selection of the gasifier type depends on the raw material. Various gasification agents, including air, oxygen, oxygen-enriched air and steam, can be employed for the gasification process.

Produced syngas followed the below formula and consist in a primarily mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen :

$$Biomass(CH_aO_bN_cS_d) + O_2 --> CO_2$$
$$Biomass(CH_aO_bN_cS_d) + CO_2 --> 2CO$$
$$Biomass(CH_aO_bN_cS_d) + H_20 --> CO + H_2$$

then when aggregate

$$Biomass(CH_aO_bN_cS_d) + O_2 + H_2O --> CO + CO_2 + H_2 + other species$$

(other species => $N_2$, $H_2S$ less than 0.3 Mole Frac(%))

## World production

Altalto, a partnership project by British Airways, Shell and Velocys, aims for the development of first commercial production of biojet at a capacity of 60 million liters/year.
BioTfueL project34, driven by a group of companies from France (Axens, CEA, IFP Energies Nouvelles,
Avril, ThyssenKrupp Industrial Solutions, Total), aims for the production of 60 t/y FT liquids.
The UPM Lappeenranta Biorefinery, producing wood-based renewable diesel from forestry residues, has started commercial production in January 2015 with 130000 t/y.

To resume, there are 24 plants for liquid fuel production with global production of liquid fuel from biomass-derived syngas (750,000 t/year); 8 plants for gaseous fuel
production (SNG and H2), with global production of gaseous fuel from biomass-derived syngas of $3.2\times 10^8 Nm^3/year$; 7 plants for chemical production (various), with global production of chemical
from biomass-derived syngas of 9000 t/year.[^7]


In the beginning of 2021, Fulcrum bioenergy and Essar Oil UK announced Fulcrum NorthPoint project which aims for annual SAF production of 100 million liters at Essar Oil site in Stanlow (UK) with planned production start-up date in 2025.

### GHG emissions

The Chapter 4 of the IPCC report predicts methane fugitive emissions from biomass gasification.  Emission factor is provided based on the carbon contents of biomass used in a selection of plants and the composition of its syngas and has a value of 18.3 kgCH4/TJ [^8].
