# Wood pyrolysis

Pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of materials at elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere. It can be applied to wood where it is burned in an oxygen free environment.

Several types of pyrolysis exist : Fast pyrolysis at 500-1000°C or slow pyrolysis at 500°C. The temperature will have a direct effect on the mass balance of the pyrolysis. If the bio-oil is the priority product, it was found that fast pyrolysis at 500°C maximize the yield, while fast pyrolysis at 1000 °C is prefered to maximize syngas production.

## Heat
Pyrolysis is typically defined as the thermochemical decomposition of biomass feedstock at medium (300–800°C) to high temperatures (800–1300°C) in an inert atmosphere.
The overall reaction of biomass feedstock is..

Biofuel +  heat  →  liquid + syngas + solid

C + H<sub>2</sub>O → CO + H<sub>2</sub> .... ΔH°= +131 kJ/mol
