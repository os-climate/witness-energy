## Definition

Bioethanol is a form of renewable energy that can be produced from agricultural feedstocks.
It can be made from very common crops such as hemp, sugarcane, potato, cassava and corn.
There has been considerable debate about how useful bioethanol is in replacing gasoline.
Concerns about its production and use relate to increased food prices due to the large amount of arable land required for crops, as well as the energy and pollution balance of the whole cycle of ethanol production, especially from corn.[^1]

What does fermentation of biomass produce?

Fermentation is an anaerobic process that breaks down the glucose within organic materials. It is a series of chemical reactions that convert sugars to alcohol or acid. Yeast or bacteria are added to the biomass material, which feed on the sugars to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide.
## Dry Milling Process

Over 90 percent of the grain ethanol produced today comes from the dry milling process, with the remaining coming from wet mills. The main difference between the two is in the initial treatment of the grain.

In dry milling, the entire grain kernel is first ground into “meal,” then slurried with water to form a “mash.”

Enzymes are added to the mash to convert starch to sugar. The mash is cooked, then cooled and transferred to fermenters. Yeast is added and the conversion of sugar to alcohol begins. After fermentation,
the resulting “beer” is separated from the remaining “stillage.” The ethanol is then distilled and dehydrated, then blended with about 2% denaturant (such as gasoline) to render it undrinkable. It is then ready for shipment.
The stillage is sent through a centrifuge that separates the solids from the solubles.
These co-products eventually become distillers grains, as well as corn distillers oil.[^2]
