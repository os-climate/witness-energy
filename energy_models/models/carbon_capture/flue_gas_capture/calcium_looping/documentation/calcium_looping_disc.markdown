**Definition[^1] :**

Calcium looping is a CO2 capture scheme using solid CaO-based sorbents to remove CO2 from flue gases, e.g., from a power plant, producing a concentrated stream of CO2 (∼95%) suitable for storage.[^3] The scheme exploits the reversible gas–solid reaction between CO2 and CaO(s) to form CaCO3(s).

[^5]
The heat required for the endothermic calcination of CaCO3 and the heat required to raise the temperature of fresh limestone from ambient temperature, can be provided by in-situ oxy-fired combustion of fuel in the calciner.

The captured CO2 is released at ~925 °C (1700 °F) by calcining the CaCO3, the heat being provided by the oxy-combustion of coal. The CO2 released by calcination combines with the gases released by combustion and passes to the Co2 purification unit prior to being compressed and sent to storage.

**Datas :**

Calcium looping heat duty 18 MJ/tCO2, electricity demand 338 MJ/tCO2[^7].

**Calculation :**

An average CO2 concentration in flue gases is calculated (Flue_gas_capture model) for the global energy mix, then the capture technology price is recalculated taking into account this variations.

Heat consumption is calculated in TWh. where, heat demand is in kWh/kg(CO2) and CO2 from flue gas is in Mt.
