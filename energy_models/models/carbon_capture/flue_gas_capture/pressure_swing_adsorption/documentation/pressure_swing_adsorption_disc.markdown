**Definition[^1] :**

Adsorption processes rely on the use of highly porous solids such as activated carbons, which are either commercially. Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) is a cyclic adsorption process, which allows continuous separation of gas streams. PSA is performed by periodic changes of pressure aiming the optimization of contaminants removal and is considered viable for separation of CO2 from flue gases containing about 5-15% v/v. To achieve a certain performance, a PSA process may consist of several steps, columns and cycle time. One of the most basic configurations comprises four steps: pressurization, feed, blowdown and purge. The performance of a PSA process is usually evaluated by the purity, recovery and productivity reached [^3]

**Calculation :**

An average CO2 concentration in flue gases is calculated (Flue_gas_capture model) for the global energy mix, then the capture technology price is recalculated taking into account this variations.
