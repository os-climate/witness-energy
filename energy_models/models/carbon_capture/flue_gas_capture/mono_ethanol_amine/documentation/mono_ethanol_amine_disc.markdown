**Definition[^1] :**

Ethanolamine is commonly called monoethanolamine or MEA in order to be distinguished from diethanolamine (DEA) and triethanolamine (TEA). It is used as feedstock in the production of detergents, emulsifiers, polishes, pharmaceuticals, corrosion inhibitors, and chemical intermediates.

A method is proposed for measuring the enthalpy of absorption of CO2 (ΔHabs) that is differential in temperature and semi-differential in loading. A 2-L reaction calorimeter was used to measure the enthalpy of absorption of CO2 with aqueous solutions of monoethanolamine (MEA) and (2-aminoethyl)ethanolamine (AEEA) over the temperature range of 40−120 °C.

**Calculation :**

An average CO2 concentration in flue gases is calculated (Flue_gas_capture model) for the global energy mix, then the capture technology price is recalculated taking into account this variations.

Heat consumption is calculated in TWh. where, heat demand is in kWh/kg(CO2) and CO2 from flue gas is in Mt.
