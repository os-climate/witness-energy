**Definition[^1] :**

Due to the fast reaction rate of piperazine (PZ) with CO2, it has the potential to act as a promoter in aqueous ammonia (NH3)-based CO2 capture processes

A new set of values for the heat capacity of aqueous mixtures of piperazine (PZ) and n-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) at different concentrations and temperatures.

Fundamentals of Piperazine process[^2]

**Calculation :**

An average CO2 concentration in flue gases is calculated (Flue_gas_capture model) for the global energy mix, then the capture technology price is recalculated taking into account this variations.

Heat consumption is calculated in TWh. where, heat demand is in kWh/kg(CO2) and CO2 from flue gas is in Mt.
