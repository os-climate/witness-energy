**Definition[^1] :**

Due to the fast reaction rate of piperazine (PZ) with CO2, it has the potential to act as a promoter in aqueous ammonia (NH3)-based CO2 capture processes

[^5]
A new set of values for the heat capacity of aqueous mixtures of piperazine (PZ) and n-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) at different concentrations and temperatures.

Fundamentals of Piperazine process[^2][^6]

**Datas :**

Piperazine heat duty 2700 MJ/tCO2, electricity demand 200 MJ/tCO2[^7].

**Calculation[^3] :**

An average CO2 concentration in flue gases is calculated (Flue_gas_capture model) for the global energy mix, then the capture technology price is recalculated taking into account this variations.

[^4]
Heat consumption is calculated in TWh. where, heat demand is in kWh/kg(CO2) and CO2 from flue gas is in Mt.
