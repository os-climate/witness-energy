**Definition[^1] :**

Gas mixtures can be effectively separated by synthetic membranes made from polymers such as polyamide or cellulose acetate, or from ceramic materials.

While polymeric membranes are economical and technologically useful, they are bounded by their performance, known as the Robeson limit (permeability must be sacrificed for selectivity and vice versa). This limit affects polymeric membrane use for CO2 separation from flue gas streams, since mass transport becomes limiting and CO2 separation becomes very expensive due to low permeabilities. Membrane materials have expanded into the realm of silica, zeolites, metal-organic frameworks, and perovskites due to their strong thermal and chemical resistance as well as high tunability (ability to be modified and functionalized), leading to increased permeability and selectivity. Membranes can be used for separating gas mixtures where they act as a permeable barrier through which different compounds move across at different rates or not move at all. The membranes can be nanoporous, polymer, etc. and the gas molecules penetrate according to their size, diffusivity, or solubility.

[^4]
These membranes are capable of near perfect selectivity for CO2 (>1,000). However, in order to achieve acceptable CO2 flux, carbonate-based membranes must operate at temperatures above 650 Â°C because oxide transport occurs in the solid phase and is very slow at lower temperatures.

**Datas :**

CO2 membrane heat demand is 0.2485 keh/kg CO2[^5],electricity demand is 1000 MJ/tCO2[^6].

**Calculation :**

An average CO2 concentration in flue gases is calculated (Flue_gas_capture model) for the global energy mix, then the capture technology price is recalculated taking into account this variations. [^3]

Heat consumption is calculated in TWh. where, heat demand is in kWh/kg(CO2) and CO2 from flue gas is in Mt.
