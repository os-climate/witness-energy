**Definition[^1] :**

The Chilled Ammonia Process is based on the chemistry of the NH3-CO2-H2O system and the ability of the ammoniated solution to absorb CO2 at low temperature and to release the CO2 at moderately elevated temperature.

**Calculation :**

An average CO2 concentration in flue gases is calculated (Flue_gas_capture model) for the global energy mix, then the capture technology price is recalculated taking into account this variations.
