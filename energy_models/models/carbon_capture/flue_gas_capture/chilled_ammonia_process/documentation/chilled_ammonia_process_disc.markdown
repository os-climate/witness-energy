**Definition[^1] :**

The Chilled Ammonia Process is based on the chemistry of the NH3-CO2-H2O system and the ability of the ammoniated solution to absorb CO2 at low temperature and to release the CO2 at moderately elevated temperature. 

[^2]
High-Pressure Regeneration The CO2 rich solution is pumped through a series of heat exchangers to heat the ionic solution to dissolve the solids using the heat available in the lean solution, which is cooled before being returned to the absorbers. As the temperature increases above 175°F (80°C), solids dissolve and a clear solution is achieved prior to injection into the regenerator.

Heat is provided to the system using low pressure steam in a thermosyphon reboiler.

**Datas :**

Chilled ammonia process heat duty 2500 MJ/tCO2, electricity demand 400 MJ/tCO2[^4].

**Calculation :**

An average CO2 concentration in flue gases is calculated (Flue_gas_capture model) for the global energy mix, then the capture technology price is recalculated taking into account this variations.

Heat consumption is calculated in TWh. where, heat demand is in kWh/kg(CO2) and CO2 from flue gas is in Mt.
