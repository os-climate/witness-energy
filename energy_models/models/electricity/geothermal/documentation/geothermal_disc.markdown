# Geothermal

**Definition[^1] :**
Geothermal energy is a type of renewable energy which is generated within the earth and can be used directly for heating or transformed into electricity. An advantage of geothermal energy over some other renewable energy sources is that it is available year-long (whereas solar and wind energy present higher variability and intermittence) and can be found around the globe. However, for electricity generation, medium- to high-temperature resources, which are usually close to volcanically active regions, are needed.

Geothermal energy technologies are distinguished into three main subtechnologies[^2], namely flash geothermal, Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC binary) geothermal and Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS). The capital investment costs of geothermal power plants depend highly on local sites.

A geothermal power plant is not producing electricity full time, in order to model yearly production a variable is set : **Capacity Factor (%)**.

**Capacity factor[^3] :** Generally defined as the ratio of actual annual output to output at rated capacity for an entire year.  

## Data     
Most of the data used for this model is extracted from  and International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)[^2], National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)[^5].
