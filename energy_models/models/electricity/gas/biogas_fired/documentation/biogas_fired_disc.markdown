# Biogas Fired Electricity

Biogas can be used in different types of internal combustion engines. Other internal combustion
engines such as gas turbines are suitable for the conversion of biogas into both electricity and
heat. The digestate is the remaining inorganic matter that was not transformed into biogas.
It can be used as an agricultural fertiliser.

Biogas can be used as the fuel in the system of producing biogas from agricultural wastes and
co-generating heat and electricity in a combined heat and power (CHP) plant.

Unlike the other green energy such as wind and solar, the biogas can be quickly accessed on demand.
The global warming potential can also be greatly reduced when using biogas as the fuel
instead of fossil fuel.[^1]

Production of high heat is calculated in TWh. Where, consumption of biogas(TWh) is more than production of electricity(TWh).

## Combined Heat and Power (CHP)

The biogas is fed into a combustion engine that turns an electrical generator producing electricity that is injected
into the electrical grid via a set of electrical protections and transformers, generating a lot of heat in the process.
Typically, a biogas CHP will convert 40% of the biogas energy into electricity, and 50% into hot water.
CHP have high capacity factor (about 95%) which means that they produce electricity steadily throughout the year.[^5]


## Data
The data used for this model is extracted partly from the IEA Data & statistics[^2] and survey on Biogas installed power
generation capacity, 2010-2018[^3] and partly from an IRENA Report[^4].
