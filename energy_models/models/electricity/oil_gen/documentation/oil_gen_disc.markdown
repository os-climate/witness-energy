**Definition**

Oil-fired generating plants burn oil to produce electricity. They are similar in construction and operation
to coal-fired and natural gas-fired facilities.[^2]

Heavy fuel oil was once a significant source of energy for electric power generation.
After oil price increases of the 1970s, oil was displaced by coal and later natural gas.
Distillate oil is still important as the fuel source for diesel engine power plants used especially in
isolated communities not interconnected to a grid. Liquid fuels may also be used by gas turbine power plants,
especially for peaking or emergency service. Of the three fossil fuel sources, oil has the advantages of easier
transportation and handling than solid coal, and easier on-site storage than natural gas.[^1]

Production of high heat is calculated in TWh. Where, consumption of liquid fuel(TWh) is more than production of electricity(TWh).

## Data

Data are extracted from IEA data tables[^3] and balances[^4]. CO2 emissions information from RTE French data[^5].

### GHG emissions


The GAINS model also predicts N2O fugitive emissions from oil energy. The emission factor is equal to 0.008 kt/PJ for oil combustion via electricity plants. [^7]
