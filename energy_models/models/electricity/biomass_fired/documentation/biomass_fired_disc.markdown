# Biomass Fired Electricity

Most biopower plants use direct-fired combustion systems. They burn biomass directly to produce high-pressure steam 
that drives a turbine generator to make electricity.

Direct combustion systems feed a biomass feedstock into a combustor or furnace, where the biomass is burned with excess
air to heat water in a boiler to create steam. Instead of direct combustion, some developing technologies gasify
the biomass to produce a combustible gas, and others produce pyrolysis oils that can be used to replace liquid fuels. 
Boiler fuel can include wood chips, pellets, sawdust, or bio-oil. Steam from the boiler is then expanded through a 
steam turbine, which spins to run a generator and produce electricity.

Drying the biomass before combusting or gasifying it improves the overall process efficiency, 
but may not be economically viable in many cases (see: Biogas Fired technology).[^1]
