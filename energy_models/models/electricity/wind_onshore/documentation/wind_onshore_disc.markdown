# Wind onshore (or Land-based wind)

**Definition[^1] :**
Wind farms consist of many individual wind turbines, which are connected to the electric power transmission network. Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electric power, competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants. Onshore wind farms have a greater visual impact on the landscape than other power stations, as they need to be spread over more land and need to be built away from dense population

Wind is split into 10 class (speed class m/s).

A wind farm is not producing electricity full time, in order to model yearly production a variable is set : **Capacity Factor (%)**.

**Capacity factor[^3] :** Generally defined as the ratio of actual annual output to output at rated capacity for an entire year.

The mechanical energy generated by the rotating blades is then transferred to a generator inside the turbine. The generator converts this mechanical energy into electrical energy. This electricity is then typically fed into the electrical grid.
While wind onshore energy production doesn't directly produce heat, it can indirectly impact heat production and consumption in a region.
## Data
Most of the data used for this model is extracted from International Energy Agency (IEA)[^4],
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)[^5], Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC)[^6] and National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)[^7].
