**Definition (extracted from [^1]):**
A coal-fired power station is a thermal power station that burns coal to generate electricity. Thermal energy produced by coal combustion converts boiler water into steam. This steam is then used to spin turbines and in turn activate generators. Coal-generated electricity represents about 38% of global electricity and produces over 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide every year. Coal-fired power plant technology development has been focused on two targets:

-Improving the average efficiency from 38% to 48% by increasing the pressure and temperature of the process (up to 650 C and 330 bar for advanced ultra-supercritical or retrofitted subcritical power plants) which allows a drop from 900 to 670 kg/MWh in CO2 emissions.

-The usage of CCUS (Carbon Capture Use & Storage) by an integrated suite of technologies. These technologies can achieve a 90% capture rate of the carbon dioxyde produced from the plants.

Production of high heat is calculated in TWh. Where, consumption of solid fuel(TWh) is more than production of electricity(TWh).

## Data

According to [^2] and based on 227 power stations, median water consumption is 2220 L/MWh.

Of the 2 080 GW existing coal fleet, 62% is 20 years old (YO) or less, 16% over 40 YO, 22% from 20 to 40 YO. [^6]

### GHG emissions


The GAINS model also predicts N2O fugitive emissions from coal energy. The emission factor is equal to 0.0014 kt/PJ. [^7]
