# Fossil Gas

Natural gas is a fossil energy source that formed deep beneath the earth's surface. Natural gas contains many different compounds. The largest component of natural gas is methane, a compound with one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms (CH4). Natural gas also contains smaller amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL, which are also hydrocarbon gas liquids), and nonhydrocarbon gases, such as carbon dioxide and water vapor. We use natural gas as a fuel and to make materials and chemicals. [^2]

It is most commonly used to produce heat or electricity for buildings or industrial processes.

Where, production of high temp heat is calculated in TWh. Its production is depends on production of methane in TWh and efficiency.

## GHG emissions

The GAINS model predicts methane fugitive emissions from gas energy. Emission factors from gas production are adopted from IPCC guidelines and a mean value has been taken for the world database of 0.142 kt/PJ [^4]. Losses of natural gas during its transport and final use are taken into account in the consumption model.
