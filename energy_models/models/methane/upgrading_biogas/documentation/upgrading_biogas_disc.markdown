# Upgrading Biogas

The upgrading process for biogas involves the removal of CO2. The most widely commercialized and used upgrading technologies are those that have for a long time been employed by the natural gas industry, pressure swing adsorption (PSA), chemical solvent scrubbing (using amines), and pressurized water scrubbing.[^2]

Amine water scrubbing is one traditional chemical solvent scrubbing method of upgrading that is applied due to its low methane slippage and its capability to provide a high purity renewable methane product.

There are many amine chemicals that dissolve into water as a solvent for biogas scrubbing such as mono-ethanol-amine (MEA), di-ethyl ethanol amine (DMEA), diethanolamine (DEA). MEA (HOC2H4NH2) was chosen for this study as previous literature has indicated it has a rapid reaction rate,low cost and low molecular weight.

The reaction between MEA and CO2 is an exothermic reaction; for each mole of CO2 absorbed in MEA solution, 72kJ of thermal energy is released.

$$2(OH - 2CH_2 - NH_2) + CO_2 <--> (OH) - (CH_2)_2 - NHCOO- + OH - (CH_2)_2 - NH_3$$
$$2(OH - (CH_2)_2 - NH_2) + H_2S <--> (HOCH_2CH_2NH_3)_2S$$
$$(HOCH_2CH_2NH_3)_2S + H_2S <-->2HOCH_2CH_2NH_3HS$$

## Data     

Economic and technical datas is taken from Vo & al [^1]. 
Currently around 3.5 Mtoe of biomethane are produced worldwide and 92.3% are from upgrading biogas[^4].
The initial age distribution has been computed with biomethane plant lists from [^5] since most of biogas is converted into biomethane.

## Cooling
[^6] Biogas upgrading process by receiving 2.393 kg/s biogas, 663.2 kW cooling energy, and 1650 kW power produces 0.5533 kg/s biomethane.
