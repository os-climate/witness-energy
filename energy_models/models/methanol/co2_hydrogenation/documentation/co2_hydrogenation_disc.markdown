## Definition

Methanol (CH3OH) is the simplest alcohol molecule. It is widely used in chemical and industrial applications as a building
block for another end product.
It can also be used as a fuel, through combustion reaction as an alternative to diesel or petroleum for thermic engines.

## CO2 hydrogenation

A CO2 stream and a dihydrogen stream are combined, and are brought together with a catalyst, to transform the mix
into $$CH_{3}OH$$.

A raw methanol stream, containing impurities (less than for syngas reforming) comes out of the catalyzer and into a distillery,
to be cooled down and remove the impurities.
