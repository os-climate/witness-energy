What Is Carbonated Water? [^1]

Carbonated water is H2O that has been infused with carbon dioxide gas under pressure. The carbonation is generally kept in the water through a concealed container, like a bottle or can, and will slowly release once the lid has been opened, forming bubbles of carbon dioxide gas. 

Carbonated water is also referred to as sparkling water, club soda, soda water, seltzer water, and fizzy water. Whatever name you associate with this bubbly drink, it’s a delicious beverage for people who opt for less traditional hydration methods. 

There are several types of carbonated beverages, some more healthy than others. These are some of the most popular:

Soda, Water, Sparkling wine, Energy drinks, Juice.

Carbonated water efficientcy is 90% . [^2]


**Chemical Reaction:**

When CO2 dissolves in H2O, water and gaseous carbon dioxide react to form a dilute solution of carbonic acid (H2CO3).

**The chemical reaction for this process is: H2O + CO2 ⇋ H2CO3**  [^3]
