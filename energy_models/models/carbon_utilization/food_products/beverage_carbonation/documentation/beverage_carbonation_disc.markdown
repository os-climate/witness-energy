**Definition :**

**Carbonation :**
beverage production

Carbonation, addition of carbon dioxide gas to a beverage, imparting sparkle and a tangy taste and preventing spoilage. The liquid is chilled and cascaded down in an enclosure containing carbon dioxide (either as dry ice or a liquid) under pressure. [^1]

Examples of carbonated beverages include soft drinks, sparkling water (seltzer water), and carbonated wine.
This technology having high efficiency. [^6]

Chemical Process: 

Some of the dissolved CO₂ reacts with the water to form carbonic acid, which has a chemical formula of H₂CO₃. So once some of the dissolved CO₂ converts to H₂CO₃, more CO₂ from the air above can dissolve into the liquid and reestablish chemical equilibrium.

When CO2 dissolves in H2O, water and gaseous carbon dioxide react to form a dilute solution of carbonic acid (H2CO3).

The chemical reaction for this process is: H2O + CO2 ⇋ H2CO3  [^2]

**Calculation :**

Water demand in liter to form 1 liter of beverage liquid is used. [^4] and co2 needs in l/l. [^5] where, heat demand and electricity demand is in kWh/kg [^7], [^9] and Total production is in Mt. [^8]
