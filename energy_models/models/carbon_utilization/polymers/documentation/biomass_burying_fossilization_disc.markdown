**Definition :**

The natural long term underground storage of the biomass leads to fossilization which originally created all the fossil energy that we use today (coal, natural gas, oil). So the fossil fuel we use today corresponds to the CO2 captured and stored by nature during millions of years. It is part of the natural cycle but it can be enforced by  biomass burying which is also considered by some researchers. This method avoids going through a usage process for the biomass and prevents the fermentation (prevents CH4 and CO2 emissions), thus corresponds to a long term storage.

According to [^2], the cost to sequestrate CO2 captured by biomass varies between 25$/tC and 100$/tC (per ton of carbon stored) which corresponds to 7$/tCO2 to 28$/tCO2, within the same range of other sequestration method.

According to [^3], dry biomass is composed of 42.5% of carbon and using molar masses we know that in order to obtain 1 kg of C we need 3,67 kg of CO2. So store 1 kg of dry biomass is equivalent to store 1,56 kg of CO2.
