What is the SOFC? [^1]
A solid oxide fuel cell (or SOFC) is an electrochemical conversion device that produces electricity directly from oxidizing a fuel. Fuel cells are characterized by their electrolyte material; the SOFC has a solid oxide or ceramic electrolyte.
Advantages of this class of fuel cells include high combined heat and power efficiency, long-term stability, fuel flexibility, low emissions, and relatively low cost. The largest disadvantage is the high operating temperature which results in longer start-up times and mechanical and chemical compatibility issues.

# Input Fuel and Oxidant Supply:

SOFCs use a variety of fuels, including hydrogen, natural gas, biogas, and other hydrocarbons.
The oxidant, typically oxygen from the air, is supplied to the cathode side of the cell.

# Working 
[^2]
In goes fuel, out comes electricity and heat. It sounds so simple, but there’s much more to the electrochemical process in a fuel cell. The energy generated is sustainable. And our solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) can already run on fuels like natural gas and biomethane, which are converted to hydrogen in the fuel cell’s reformer. What’s important to know is that when it operates with natural gas or biomethane, carbon emissions are reduced by about two-thirds compared to power generation from coal. In the future, it will be possible to combine several SOFC systems, each with an output of 100 kW, to create a decentralized power supply solution in the megawatt range. Compared to a coal-fired power plant with a one megawatt output, the SOFCs’ carbon emissions are more than 4,000 metric tons lower per year. What’s even more important is the fact that our SOFC system will also be able to run on pure hydrogen in the future. The benefit of pure hydrogen as a fuel is that there are no CO2 emissions — other than electricity and heat, it only produces water!.

# Generation of Electricity and Heat:

The flow of electrons through the external circuit generates electricity, which can be used to power electrical devices or stored in batteries.
Heat is also produced as a byproduct of the electrochemical reactions occurring within the SOFC.
The combined electricity and heat output can be utilized for various applications, such as power generation, heating, and cogeneration (combined heat and power).

# Output
The output of the SOFC system is impressive. Just when generating power, its efficiency is approximately 60 percent at beginning of life. When the heat generated by the SOFC is also put to productive use, the SOFC system can even reach an overall efficiency of up to 90 percent.

# Efficiency and Environmental Benefits

SOFCs offer high efficiency in converting fuel energy into electricity and heat, typically ranging from 50% to 60% in electrical efficiency.
They produce low emissions of pollutants compared to traditional combustion-based power generation technologies, making them environmentally friendly.
