# SOFC

What is the SOFC? [^2]



Working  :

Electric heating is the process of converting electrical current into heat energy. The heating element within an electric heater is called an electrical resistor, and when an electric current passes through the resistor, this is where the heat is created.

An electric boiler is fed with cold water from the mains water supply.

Electricity is fed to the boiler from the mains electricity supply to the heating element within the boiler and they work essentially like giant kettles – using electricity and a metal element to heat the water.

The cold water is passed over the metal heating element and heat is transferred, resulting in hot water that can be supplied to the radiators and taps on-demand or from a hot water storage cylinder.

The exact way in which the boiler works in terms of heating and storing the water depends on the type of electric boiler/heater used.
