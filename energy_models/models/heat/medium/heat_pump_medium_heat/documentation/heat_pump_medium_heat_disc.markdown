**Definition (extracted from [^1]):**
-A heat pump extracts heat from a source, such as the surrounding air, geothermal energy stored in the ground, or nearby sources of water or waste heat from a factory.

[^2] A heat pump can be an energy-efficient alternative to fossil-fuel furnaces and water heaters that use natural gas and heating oil, which emit CO2 directly. Heat pumps also are more efficient than electric resistance heat. Switching from fossil fuel heat-generating devices, such as furnaces and boilers, to an efficient electric heat pump can be step toward a zero-carbon system.

COP (Coefficient of Performance) [^3]
The Co-efficient of performance (COP) is an expression of the efficiency of a heat pump. When calculating the COP for a heat pump, the heat output from the condenser (Q) is compared to the power supplied to the compressor (W).

COP is defined as the relationship between the power (kWh) that is drawn out of the heat pump as cooling or heat, and the power (kWh) that is supplied to the compressor.
