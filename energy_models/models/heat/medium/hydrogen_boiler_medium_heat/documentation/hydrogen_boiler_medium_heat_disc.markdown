# Hydrogen Boiler

What is a hydrogen boiler? [^8], [^6], [^10], [^11]

it is a boiler that burns hydrogen as opposed to natural gas (or methane). These appliances work in a very similar way to natural gas boilers, by burning the gas via combustion, which in turn creates hot flue gases that can be used to heat water. This hot water can be stored for later use and pumped around your radiators to warm up your home.

As hydrogen is a thinner gas than methane, some parts of the boiler may differ slightly, including the flame detector and the burner (which we look at in more detail further down the page) but they work in much the same way as your current boiler.

Hydrogen boilers are considered to be a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional boilers, as burning hydrogen gas produces only water vapour as a byproduct, without releasing harmful greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide or methane.

Hydrogen does not produce carbon dioxide when it burns; it only produces water vapour.

When the hydrogen molecule is burned (hydrogen combustion) with oxygen gas, the bonds between two hydrogen atoms are broken as well as those between oxygen atoms to make up bonds between hydrogen and oxygen atoms. In layman's terms, burning hydrogen results in water: H2 + 1 2 O2 −→ H2O + 286, 000 joules.

Working[^9] :

The hydrogen and oxygen gases are mixed together before being ignited in a catalytic burner. Hydrogen is more flammable than natural gas and so the burners on hydrogen boilers are specially designed so that the flames can be limited if too much gas is flowing through. A flame detection component is also required in a hydrogen-only boiler as hydrogen flames are invisible.

Replacing natural gas boilers with hydrogen gas may be the simplest solution to the nation’s heating problems. Hydrogen is a carbon-free fuel source and can fit into a current boiler’s physical space without much disruption.

Medium temperature heat in Hydrogen boiler technology, the temperature range is 100 to 400 degree C.

In Hydrogen demand calculation, Hydrogen is used to produce 1kwh of heat (this information in kwh) : hydrogen_needs is in 
kwh of hydrogen / kwh of heat [^5]

Price of hydrogen is in $/kWh of heat.
Production in 2021 that is total heat produced by Hydrogen boiler is 13 million metric tons (Mt)= 541.6666667 TWh
Initial production for medium heat temp = 180.55 TWh [^7]
