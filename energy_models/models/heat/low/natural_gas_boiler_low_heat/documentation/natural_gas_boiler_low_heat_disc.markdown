# Natural Gas Boiler [^2], [^4]

A gas-fired boiler provides hot water to taps throughout the home and also to radiators in the central heating system.

Low temperature heat in natural gas technology, the temperature range is below 100 degree C.

In Methane demand calculation, Methane is used to produce 1kwh of heat (this information in kwh) : methane_needs is in kwh of methane / kwh of heat

price of methane is in $/kWh of heat.

CO2 production is in Kg/KWh. That values from methane: CO2 per use(kg/kg) / calorific value(KWh/kg) [^6], [^7]

production in 2020 that is total heat produced by Natural gas is 6236761 TJ = 1683 TWh [^9]
    
initial production for low heat temp = 561 TWh [^8]

Gas boilers work by releasing the fuel through a gas valve into a sealed combustion chamber in the boiler through small jets. With an electrical ignition, the gas is combusted to create heat. This heat is absorbed by a connected pipe carrying cold water.

Working[^1] :
Hot gases are produced by burning fuel in the furnace. These hot gases are made to come in contact with the water vessel where the heat transfer takes place between the water and the steam. Therefore, the basic principle of the boiler is to convert water into steam by using heat energy.

Natural gas consists mostly methane (typical >85%) with the balance being varying amounts of ethane, propane, butane and some inert components (nitrogen, carbon dioxide and helium). [^5]
