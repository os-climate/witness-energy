**Definition :**

The CO2 mineralization process is proposed by carbfix [^1] amongst others. The process consists of the dissolution of CO2 into water and inject the CO2- heavy water to react with basalt rocks. The CO2-heavy water reacts with Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg) contained in basalt for long term storage.

$$CaO + CO_2 --> CaCO_3$$
$$MgO + CO_2 --> MgCO_3$$

The researchers report that approximately 80% of the carbon becomes embedded in the minerals over the span of one year, which leads to acceptable reaction time. The storage into basalt has been demonstrated to be cost effective at less than 25$ per ton of CO2.
